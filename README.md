Dear Professor George, 
    
Thank you for using our appliance simulator. Please follow the instructions below to make the most out of our program.
    
Step 1: Run the program "Appliance Generator" to generate a CSV file of appliances. Our client class automatically uses this file (AppliancesToUse.csv) during the appliance simulation, you do not need to manually input the file.
    
Step 2: Run the program "AppClient" to start the simulator. You will be prompted to add the user data. The program will show five options, please select one. Note that if you enter something other than the five given options, you will be prompted again 
    
    Enter “A” to add an appliance. 
    
    You will need following information to add an appliance successfully:
    
        An eight-digit location ID between 10000001 and 10000100 
    
        The appliance name/description 
    
        Power used by the appliance in watts 
    
        The probability that the appliance is on, 
    
        Whether or not your appliance is smart, and if so, the reduction of power in the low state. This option is automatically set to zero for non-smart (regular) appliances
    
    Enter “D” to delete an appliance. 
    
        You will need to enter the eight-digit ID of the appliance that you want to delete (the program will output the ID range from 90000001 to about 90001771). If there is an issue with deletion, the program will print out a message and take you back to the main menu. If the deletion is successful, the program will print a message to the console
    
    Enter “L” to see the list of appliances. 
    
        You will be prompt with two more options. If you type "A”, All appliances for a location will be shown and if you type "B", you can view appliance list (smart or regular appliances).  Type “S” for smart appliance list or type “R” for regular appliance list. 
    
    After inputting your data to the simulator, you can select “S” in the main menu to start the simulation. Keep in mind that after you start the simulation you can’t add/delete any appliances. Select “Y” to confirm that you are ready to start the simulator.
    
        You will be asked to enter the total allowed wattage (power) in watts, and the number of steps you want this simulation to run.
    
        Congratulations! Your simulation is complete. Our program will provide you the results on the console. If you need more information, please see “detailedReport.txt”. It will be overwritten every time you run the simulation.
    
        You can choose to go back to the main menu by typing "yes," or you can type anything else to terminate.
    
    If you want to quit the simulation at any point please select “Q” when you are in the main menu.
    
As always, if there is an issue with inputs, an error message will be printed to the screen and you will be taken back to the main menu.
    
We are so grateful to you for giving us a wonderful opportunity to make this project. This was a great learning experience that resulted in an awesome project, and we hope we met your expectations.
